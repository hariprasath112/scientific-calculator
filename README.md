After each operation the screen clears and modifies memory value between green lines and generates program again. The trignometric function use radians as it is prebuilt in math.h, input is converted to radians for function to perform. After facing difficulties using the clear screen function, replit's online complier poroved to be most effective in exectuing the program.
