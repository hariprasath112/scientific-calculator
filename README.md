# Scientific Calculator in C Language

The calculator has built-in functions (upto 9) from math.h header file. It can perform operations using 16-byte integers as it uses "long double" data type.



After each operation the screen clears and modifies memory value between green lines and generates program again. The trigonometric function use radians as it is prebuilt in math.h, input is converted to radians for function to perform. After facing difficulties using the clear screen function, replit's online complier proved to be most effective in executing the program.
